## TODO

- [x] [**YoloV4 object detector with opencv-python implementation**](https://youtu.be/1aL6tewfxFY)

- [x] I will create distance estimation using yolo object detection,😊

```
pip3 install opencv-contrib-python==4.5.3.56

```
### Clone this repo

`git clone https://github.com/Asadullah-Dal17/yolov4-opencv-python`

Guess what you are done that was not hard, isn't it.😉

I have use tiny weights, check out more on [_Darknet_](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) github for more
